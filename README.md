# CSS_Portfolio_Website
Portfolio of work to show case web applications via website


## Description
This is a quick look at my portfolio website. This website contains a couple items of my previous work such as Run Buddy and Horiseon. There are also some other links that are yet to be added, but will be added once I finish those projects as well. There's a small backstory about myself at the top and contact links of me at the bottom and once I have items to add a resume at the very bottom of the website as well.
