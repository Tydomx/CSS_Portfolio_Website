        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Preview</h3>
        <p>My name is Michael Thai and I was born in Austin, Texas. My parents and grandparents are from Vietnam and
            immigrated to the US before I was born. I have a cat named Sammi who's going to turn 17 years old this year
            and has been with me since I was little. I also have an older sister who's about a generation older than me,
            so growing up I looked up to her a lot. She's one of the reasons why I'm taking this bootcamp at the University
            of Texas-Austin and I don't regret it at all. </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Things I like to do that aren't coding would be playing video games, working out and reading. Currently I'm playing this game called Elden Ring hence the little avatar I have at the top</p>
